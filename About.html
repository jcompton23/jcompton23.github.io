<p>Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website. I hope you can find what you are looking for. Please feel free to visit the contact page for more information. I would love to hear from you. <br /><br />
As a recent graduate of the University of North Texas with a B.A. in Marketing, I have a valuable amount of hands-on experience from academia. This would include:
<UL> 
<li>Re-branding a local restaurant to increase sales during quiet hours</li>
<li>Creating and presenting a proposal to integrate a small charity into the Koch Foundation</li>
<li>Crafting and delivering a presentation to a representative of Fidelity Investments aimed at helping Fidelity attract a younger client base.
</UL>
<p>I have also spent the last two years at Texas Motor Speedway as both an intern and supervisor in the Fan Relations department. Personally, I am passionate about the digital side of marketing.<br /> This past year I acquired my GAIQ, HubSpot Inbound and AdWords Search certifications. Can you tell that I also enjoy coding and web design? </p>
